# Transformers For Natural Language Processing
---

This is a repo with my code from the Udemy [Transformers for Natural Language Processing](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-transformers-nlp) course. All the kudos and credits for this code belong to the author of the course, I am using it only for learning purposes.

*Note: This is not the original code. Mostly it is unchanged, but there are some modifications comparing to what is in the course. I also skipped some of the notebooks, mainly from the first section of the course.*
